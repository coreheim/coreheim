# Leaders
Warriors within **7”** of their warband leader may use the leader’s **Leadership (Ld)** characteristic instead of their own.  
This does **not** apply if the leader is _knocked down_ or _stunned_.
- **Animals** cannot use the leader’s Ld.
- If a leader is taken _out of action_, the warband has **no leader** for the rest of the battle.
- After the battle, the **hero with the highest Ld** gains the **Leader** ability.
   - If there is a tie, you may choose.
- If you re-hire a warrior designated as the warband leader on the warband list _(e.g., Mercenary Captain)_, he **automatically becomes** the leader again—even if others have higher Ld.
# Stupidity
Warriors suffering from _stupidity_ must be within **7”** of a **non-stupid Hero** from their warband at the start of each **Recovery phase**.  
If not, they **do nothing** until they start another turn within 7” of such a Hero.  
_Heroes that are knocked down or stunned cannot alleviate stupidity._
- Warriors that **do nothing** due to stupidity:
   - May still strike back in close combat
   - May take armour saves as normal
# Hatred
- Warriors that _hate_ their opponents may always strike them in close combat, **even if other enemies are also present**.
- May target them with missile fire, **even if other enemies are closer**.
# Panic Tests
At the start of each **Close Combat phase**, before any blows are struck, test for panic:
- Only the **active player’s warriors** test for panic.
- A warrior engaged in close combat with **two or more enemies** and **no friendly warriors** in that same combat must take a panic test.
- If the warrior **fails** their Ld test:
   - They may **not strike back** in close combat that turn.
   - They may fight as normal in the opponent’s combat phase.
# Fear
## Fear During Combat
- Warriors **charging** or **being charged** by an enemy that causes fear must pass a **Leadership test** or suffer **-2 WS roll** this round of combat.
## General Fear Rules
- Failing **multiple** Fear tests **stacks**.
- Warriors that **cause Fear** are **immune to Fear**.
- Fear is not active while the fear-causer is _knocked down_ or _stunned_.
- Fear applies when **intercepting** or being **intercepted** by a fear-causing enemy.
# Regeneration
- Warriors with **Regeneration** gain a **4+ armour save**, modified as normal.
- **Flaming hits** completely **negate** this save.
