# Shooting
Warriors armed with missile weapons may shoot once during their Shooting phase. If they are armed with multiple missile weapons, they must choose which one to fire. Work through your warriors individually, one at a time, in any order you wish.
- Shooting requires Line-of-Sight. Warriors can see 360° around themselves.
- Warriors **cannot** shoot through allied warriors.
- Warriors **cannot** shoot on the same turn they moved more than half their Movement (rounded up).
- Warriors **cannot** shoot if they are engaged in close combat, _knocked down_, or _stunned_.
- When firing a missile weapon, a warrior shoots just once, regardless of how many **A**ttacks he has on profile.
## Targeting
- Warriors **must** shoot at the closest target, but may ignore enemies that are _knocked down_ or _stunned_.
- If the closest target suffers from Ballistic Skill (BS) penalties, you may choose a more distant target **provided** it is equally or more easily hit.  
  _(BS penalties include Cover, the ‘Dodge’ skill, Skaven Smoke Bombs, etc.)_
- A warrior firing from an elevated position **2” or more above ground level** may fire at any visible target **unless** there is a visible enemy within 3”.  
  _(If there is, follow normal targeting rules.)_
- You **cannot** fire into close combat involving your own warriors.  
- You **may** fire into close combat between two other warbands. Roll to randomize hits.
## Warriors with Multiple Shots
A warrior with multiple shots may divide them up as he chooses. However:
- All attacks must be distributed **up front**, before rolling to hit.  
  _(Some attacks may go to waste.)_
- He can only target warriors that he could **normally** target.
## Out of Range
When targeting with missile weapons:
- **You may not** measure the distance beforehand.
- If the target is out of range, the weapon is still considered to have fired.
## Hitting
Roll a Ballistic Skill (BS) test with any modifiers. Note that after modifiers a 6 will always hit.
### Modifiers to Hit:
- **-1 BS**: Target is in Cover (partially obscured by terrain or warriors).
- **-1 BS**: Moved and shot this turn (excluding standing up or pivoting).
- **-1 BS**: Target has the ‘Dodge’ skill.
If you score a hit, roll to wound.  
_(See the Wounds and Injuries section.)_
## 💡 Play Tip

> **Coreheim** assumes about **70% terrain coverage** on the table.  
> Without enough terrain, shooting becomes too powerful.  
> If terrain is sparse, **reduce all BS values by 1** to balance gameplay.
