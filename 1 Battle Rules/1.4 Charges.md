# Declaring Charges
- You may charge any visible, non-_hidden_ enemy, but you may **not** measure the distance beforehand.
- You may engage multiple enemies if they are within 1” of each other and not behind the charge target.
- All charges are declared simultaneously.
- To determine how many fighters can fit into close combat, you may rearrange your own warriors but **not** the enemy’s.
- Unless a charge involves climbing, chargers must take the most direct route to the charge target.
## Charges Involving Climbing
- When charging requires climbing, you must pass a **single** Initiative test or fail the charge.  
  _(If you climbed down and fail, you also fall the entire distance.)_
- The climbing part of the charge may **not** exceed 6”.
## Charges Involving Jumping Down
- When Jumping Down, take an Initiative test **for each full 2”** jumped.  
  _(If you fail any one of those tests, you fall the entire distance and fail the charge.)_
- Jumping Down does **not** use Movement (M).  
  _(So if you had M6 you could move 2”, jump up to 7” down, and move up to 4”)_
- **Diving Charges**:  
  If a charge involving Jumping Down is executed so that the charger lands within 2” of his target and has enough Movement left to successfully charge the enemy, then that charge is a diving charge.
- Diving Chargers have +1 to their Strength roll for the first round of combat.  
  _(This may take them above their racial maximum.)_
## Charging Enemies out of Line-of-Sight
Warriors can charge enemies out of their Line-of-Sight (e.g., behind a wall, around a corner, etc.) as far as they have Movement. To charge a non-visible enemy, the warrior must pass an Initiative test or fail the charge.  
_(This is cumulative with other Initiative tests such as Climbing, etc.)_
## Charging Hidden Enemies
Hidden warriors cannot be charged.
## Intercepting Enemies
Warriors that are within 2” of a moving enemy, not in combat, may intercept the charging warrior by moving into the movement line.
- Any kind of move may be intercepted: normal moves, charges, flying moves, etc.
- Each enemy can only be intercepted by a single warrior.
- For even more on intercepting see [[4.8 Interception]].

**Grey marks the interception zone.**

## Failed Charges
If a warrior fails a charge for whatever reason:
- He is moved 4” towards the charge target, or to where he fell or failed his climb/Initiative test.
- Stop if this would bring the warrior within 1” of his target.
- Warriors that fail a charge may **not** shoot missile weapons, but they **may** cast spells or prayers.
