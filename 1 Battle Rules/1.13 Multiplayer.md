### Alliances
- Players can make and break alliances as they choose.
- Allied warbands may choose to end battles peacefully if no enemies remain on the battlefield.
**However:**
- Warriors from an allied warband **do not** count for panic tests.
- Warriors **cannot** use the Leadership (LD) of an allied leader.
- Spells or effects targeting “friendly” or “allied” warriors **do not** benefit allies.
- Each warband must spot _hidden_ enemies independently (i.e., an enemy may be spotted by one warband but remain hidden to another).
### Close Combat
- Warriors engaged in close combat fight during the close combat phase of each opponent they are fighting.
- This can give a warrior multiple attacks per player cycle.
### Shooting
- You may shoot into close combat where an allied warrior is involved.
- Roll to randomize hits.
- Allies killed by friendly fire still yield experience for the shooter.
### Underdog Experience and Multiplayer 
When determining whether underdog experience is granted, players compare with the warband that has the 2nd highest rating.`
