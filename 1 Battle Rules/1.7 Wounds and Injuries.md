# Wounding
Once you have hit an enemy with close combat, missile fire, or spells, roll a **Strength** check modifying the result by the targets **Toughness Modifier**.
## Armour Saves
When an armoured warrior suffers a wound, they may annul it by passing their **armour save**.  
_See the Armour Save chart [[4.5 Combat Tables]]._
## Critical Wounds
A **natural 6** to wound causes a **critical wound**, which is **doubled to two wounds**.
- Enemies take armour saves as normal but must **roll separately for each wound**.
- If the attacker needs 6s to wound the target after the Toughness Modifier, they **cannot** cause critical wounds.
- If the opponent has fewer Wounds than inflicted, roll an extra D6 for injury rolls per excess wound and pick the **highest** result.  
   _(Same as with multiple normal wounds.)_
## Warriors with Multiple Wounds
When a warrior with multiple Wounds on their profile suffers a wound:
- **Deduct 1 wound** from their total per wound suffered.
- Lost wounds apply only for the **remainder of the battle**.
## Injury Rolls
Whenever a warrior’s **Wounds are reduced to 0**, roll a D6 to determine the extent of their injury. 
If multiple wounds are taken in the same turn, roll a D6 **for each**, and apply the **highest** result:
### Injury Roll Results
