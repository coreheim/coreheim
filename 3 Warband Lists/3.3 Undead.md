**105gc to hire**

Vampires lead the Undead in their search for the magical stones that will give their master the power to conquer the Empire. Most of them serve the undying count of Sylvania, but some have found the city to their liking, and have become independent.

## 0-1 Necromancer

## 0-3 Dregs
**15gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
Dregs are the most miserable human survivors of Mordheim. They are deformed and rejected individuals who were often scavengers before. Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and treat them with surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs are often fanatically loyal to their Undead overlords and will do anything to protect and serve them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be sent to acquire equipment from the settlements around Mordheim and also be made to carry heavy bags.

**Starting Experience: 0**
Skeletons are the aging remains of fallen warriors, re-animated by the power of necromancy. A regiment of Skeletons will never flee from hand-to-hand combat. Skeletons are supernatural creatures which cause fear and are immune to this type of psychology themselves.
