## Night Goblin Special Equipment
### Great Cave Squig Mount
* **Cost**: ***75gc**
* **Rarity**: **Rare 11+**
Only the most intelligent of the ferocious Squigs can be trained to be ridden into combat. Given their rarity, Night Goblins treat the Great Squigs with an almost mythological respect.

# Heroes
## 1 Boss
**50gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 20**
Operating independently of Orcs, the Night Goblin Bosses who lead the Clans to war are typically those who manifest an acute 'Gork complex'. This usually involves emulating an Orc Warboss and lauding it over his underlings but Night Goblin Bosses are also amongst the sneakiest and most cunning members of their tribe.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 2+  | 2+  | 4+  | +0  | 1   | 3+  | 1   | 7+  |
**SPECIAL RULES**
**Leader** (Friendly warriors within 7”may use his Leadership instead of their own.)
**Hate Dwarves, Fear Elves**
## 0-1 Shaman
**30gc to hire
Starting Experience: 6**
Night Goblin Shamans constitute the spiritual backbone of the Clans, and are also expert at identifying, growing and using fungi. According to Night Goblin mythology it was the shaman caste that first led tribes of common steppe goblins to take up residence underground.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 3+  | 3+  | 4+  | +0  | 1   | 4+  | 1   | 8+  |
**SPECIAL RULES**
**Hate Dwarves, Fear Elves**
**Wizard**: Uses Waaagh! Magic and starts with **two** spells.
## 0-3 Rogues
**20gc to hire
Starting Experience: 2**
Occasionally a Night Goblin is born that is visibly more cunning than his fellow Night Goblins. Such Rogues are much envied amongst Goblins for their prowess in backstabbing and acquiring coin and soon become heroes who lead the Night Goblins to Mordheim, hoping to one day become bosses themselves, should the current Boss suffer some kind of "accident" in the ruins.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 3+  | 4+  | 4+  | +0  | 1   | 4+  | 1   | 9+  |
**SPECIAL RULES**
**Hate Dwarves, Fear Elves** (Warriors that hate their enemies may strike at them in Close Combat even while fighting other enemies standing up, and may target them with Missile Fire even if other enemies are closer.)
# Henchmen
## Night Goblin Runts
**15gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
Night Goblins live in underground tunnels where they subsist on fungi, beetles, and bits of each other. They wear black robes to hide in shadows and to protect themselves from sunlight.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 4+  | 4+  | 4+  | +0  | 1   | 4+  | 1   | 9+  |
**SPECIAL RULES**
**Hate Dwarves, Fear Elves**
## 0-1 River Troll
**115gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
After the destruction of Mordheim, Trolls have wandered into the ruins, taking up shelter under the urban bridges that cross the river Stir. Night Goblins feed these monsters to gain their loyalty and harness them for battle.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 3+  | -   | 2+  | -1  | 3   | 5+  | 3   | 10+ |
**SPECIAL RULES**
**Armour Piercing 1**, **Regeneration** (A Troll has a
4+ amour save that is modified as normal and
completely negated by flaming hits.)
**Monster**: Cause Fear, Immune to Panic, Stupidity, No Experience, No Weapons or Armour, No Penalties for Fighting Unarmed, No Scenario Objectives, Cannot Hide, Additional +15 Warband Rating, Rolls on the Heroes Post-game Injury Chart (D66).
(Monsters may Climb as normal.)
## 0-5 Cave Squigs
**20gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Squigs are a curious blend of animal and fungus, and are composed mostly of teeth, and a nasty temperament. Although they are wild and dangerous, it is possible to herd them by means of pitchforks, firebrands and the like.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9   | 2+  | -   | 3+  | +0  | 1   | 3+  | 1   | 9+  |
## 0-2 Fanatics
**35gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Fanatics bear a ball and chain so large that it would normally be impossible for a Goblin to pick it up. A Fanatic’s strength is boosted beyond belief, enabling him to swing the heavy ball round and round (and round and round...) in a whirlwind of bone-shattering death.

| M   | WS  | BS  | S   | T   | W   | I   | A   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 4+  | -   | 3+  | +0  | 1   | 3+  | 2   | 9+  |
**SPECIAL RULES**
**Immune to Fear, Immune to Panic, Cannot** **Hide, No Scenario Objectives**
**Twitchy**: When determining experience advances Fanatics may increase the same characteristic twice, even though they are henchmen.
