_“…consequently we can conclude that these so-called ‘Rat-men’ are likely no more than pastime tales of the rural population.”_ - Excerpt from the lecture ‘Of our good-hearted country-folk’, by Professor Hans Duhr at the Imperial University of Altdorf
_“Go gently in Mordheim. You don’t want the man-things to start believing in rat-men again, do you?”_ - Steiss the Shadow, Eshin Seer

## 1 Eshin Assassin
**70gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 20**
Assassins are the master warriors of Clan Eshin, entrusted with the rank of Paw Leader and thus the command of an Eshin triad. Not traditional leaders as such, they place more value on leading by example as they execute their lightning-fast assassination strikes, only to slip back into the shadows of the damned city.

**20gc to hire
Starting Experience: 4**
Adepts are the young apprentices of Clan Eshin. Recently initiated into the secrets of the clan, they make up for their lack of knowledge with their ambition and energy.
They have the reputation of being able to turn invisible, appearing from the shadows only to deliver poisoned death to their destined victims. Success means many breeders. Failure on the other hand, is best not contemplated.
