_“They call my methods unscrupulous. But I ask you, are these not unscrupulous times?”_ - Inquisitor Zacharias Bernard, before entering Mordheim

## 1 Inquisitor
**60gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 20**
The Grand Theogonist has granted his representatives edict to cleanse Mordheim of Chaos filth. While he carries this edict, this man has the divine right to judge Chaos worshippers wherever he might find them.

**Hates Wizards** (Warriors that hate their enemies may strike at them in Close Combat even while fighting other enemies standing up, and may target them with Missile Fire even if other enemies are closer.)
## 0-1 Priest of Sigmar
**35gc to hire
Starting Experience: 6**
Many powerful fighting men have come from the ranks of the faithful. The Priests of Sigmar are exception, and the military wing of the cult is feared and respected throughout the Empire. With fire burning in their eyes, the Warrior-Priests stride into battle, chanting aloud the Deus Sigmar, the praise of the patron god of the Empire.

## 0-2 Witch Hunters
**30gc to hire
Starting Experience: 4**
Witch Hunters are members of the grim Order of Witch Hunters, dedicated to eradicating Chaos and all its minions. Usually they prowl the Old World individually trying and executing the enemies of Sigmar, but the situation in Mordheim requires them to band together.

# Henchmen
## Zealots
**20gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
When a man loses his family, home and all he cared for, religion is often the last refuge left to him. Such men become wandering pilgrims, bitter and dangerous fanatics who are prepared to avenge their loss at any cost. These men are called Zealots. Zealots have forsaken their former lives and exist only to destroy evil and the minions of Chaos. Whilst they might have been peasants and craftsmen before and thus may not be as dangerous in a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism should not be underestimated. Witch Hunters find ready allies in their ranks, and many a band of Zealots are led by Witch Hunters.

## 0-5 Warhounds
**20gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Witch Hunters keep packs of ferocious attack dogs. With their huge jaws and powerful bite, they are perfect for hunting down (and tearing apart) any heretics, mutants, deviants and witches.

## 0-5 Flagellants
**30gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Flagellants are fanatics and madmen obsessed with the end of the world. They are often men who have lost their families to war or the ravages of nature, and have also lost their minds. With insane persistence, they travel the length and breadth of the Empire, preaching their view of the end of the world. With their rousing speeches, Witch Hunters can muster these dangerous lunatics to fight in the streets of Mordheim, where no sane man dares tread. Flagellants are extremely dangerous opponents in close combat.
