##### Meteor Type
Roll for each Wyrdstone meteor what type it is.
1. Scattered
2. Impact Line
3. Building Impact
4. Meteor Shower
5. Landed Near Monsters Den
6. Large Meteors
### Players choose missions
1. Randomly decide warband order
2. Each warband one at a time decides which meteor location to go to. If there is an odd number of players the final player may either choose to play a multi-battle or sit out a game.
#### Mission Setup
1. Divide your warband into 3 groups.
	- Divide the heroes and henchmen evenly.
2. The player that chose the mission first sets up one of their warbands groups first.
3. The other player sets up one of their warband groups.
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3.
5. Play begins with the player that chose the mission first.
6. On the second round each player places their third warband group within 2" of the board edge that they set up on during their recovery phase.
### Mission AI Calculation
If you don't want to play out each AI battle then use the following to determine the battle results.
1. Randomly roll to see who wins.
	1. If one warband has underdog they will win the game on a 1-2 on a 1d6.
2. Determine how many injuries and make injury rolls:
	1. Roll 1d6 for winning warband to determine how many units were injured.
	2. Roll 1d6 for losing warband but if the number is lower then their rout threshold, use that number instead for the units injured.
3. Roll exploration:
	1. Winner rolls 5d6 and lose rolls 3d6.
## Touching Wyrdstone
Roll 1d6 when picking up Wyrdstone
	1. -1 to all rolls
	2. -1 to movement
	3. Nothing
	4. Nothing
	5. +1 to movement
	6. +1 to all rolls

For all Wyrdstone effects roll 1d6 in your recovery phase. On a 1-2 the effect ends.
