**Experience:**  
`2  4  6  7`
## Skills
* **Leader**: Units can use this leaders leadership value while within 7"
* **Daemon**: Cause Fear, No Pain (Treats Stunned as Knocked Down.)
* **Daemon Soul**: Treat all campaign injuries as full recovery except for rolls of ‘Dead’ , ‘Captured’, ‘Robbed’, or ‘Sold to the Pits’.
* **Wizard**: Uses [Chaos Rituals](4%20Magic/Chaos%20Rituals.md). Starts with one spell.
* **Blackblood**: When an Aspiring Champion is taken out of action, all warriors within 1" take 1 automatic S 3+ hit. (Also affects friendly models.) // (Take Armour Saves as normal.)
* **Apprentice Magic**: Magisters are not Wizards but may learn spells from the ‘Chaos Rituals’ lore. However, each time a Magister learns a new spell (or reduces the difficulty of spell that he already knows) he must roll on the Heroes’ Post-game Injury Chart on page 60, treating any rolls of 'Captured' and 'Sold to the Pits' as 'Multiple Injuries' instead. (Learning spells will make a warrior count as a Wizard.)
* **Daemons**: Cause Fear, No Pain (Treats Stunned as Knocked Down.)
* **Animals**: Cannot Climb, Cannot Hide, Cannot use the Leader’s Ld, No Scenario Objectives, No Weapons or Armour, No Penalties for Fighting Unarmed, and No Experience.
* **Heirloom**: Daemon Robes (Heirloom: Warrior has this item when hired. It may not be swapped or sold, but may be discarded and robbed as normal.)
