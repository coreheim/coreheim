Vampires lead the Undead in their search for the magical stones that will give their master the power to conquer the Empire. Most of them serve the undying count of Sylvania, but some have found the city to their liking, and have become independent.

## 0-1 Necromancer
**30gc to hire
Starting Experience: 6**

## 0-3 Dregs
**15gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
Dregs are the most miserable human survivors of Mordheim. They are deformed and rejected individuals who were often scavengers before. Vampires often recruit Dregs as their servants and treat them with surprising kindness. As a result, Dregs are often fanatically loyal to their Undead overlords and will do anything to protect and serve them.
Dregs are very useful to their masters as they can be sent to acquire equipment from the settlements around Mordheim and also be made to carry heavy bags.

## 0-2 Dire Wolves

## 0-8 Crypt Ghouls
**40gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Ghouls are the descendants of famished men who once took to feasting on corpses to survive.

## Skeletons
**25gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
