## 1 Possessed
**100gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 20**
Possessed are nightmarish creatures, a melding of flesh, metal and black magic. Inside them lives a supernatural thing of evil, a Daemon from the dark reaches of the Realm of Chaos. They are amongst the most dangerous of the creatures of Mordheim.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8   | 1   | 2   | +0  | 6+  | -   | 5+  | 4+  |

**SPECIAL RULES**
**Leader, May Wear Armour and Cast Spells.**
**Daemon**: Cause Fear, No Pain (Treats Stunned as Knocked Down.)
**Daemon Soul**: Treat all campaign injuries as full recovery except for rolls of ‘Dead’ , ‘Captured’, ‘Robbed’, or ‘Sold to the Pits’.
**Wizard**: Uses [Chaos Rituals](4%20Magic/Chaos%20Rituals.md). Starts with one spell.
## 0-2 Aspiring Champions
**30gc to hire
Starting Experience: 4**
Aspiring Champions are humans who have risen to the top of the covens. They are well on their way to full daemonic possession and the first signs, such as small horns and corrosive black blood, are already beginning to show.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 1   | 1   | +0  | 9+  | 10+ | 7+  | 6+  |

**SPECIAL RULES**
**Blackblood**: When an Aspiring Champion is taken out of action, all warriors within 1" take one WS 7+ hit. (Also affects friendly models.) // (Take Armour Saves as normal.)
## 0-2 Magisters
**15gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
Magisters are clever and devious types who through their love of arcane knowledge have turned to the scrolls and tomes of the Dark Gods. Whilst they may have been scholars, scribes or magistrates before, they now deal in the occult, hoping to gain magic powers that will ultimately grant them mastery of past and future, life and death.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 1   | 1   | +0  | 10+ | 10+ | 7+  | 9+  |

**SPECIAL RULES**
**Apprentice Magic**: Magisters are not Wizards but may learn spells from the [Chaos Rituals](4%20Magic/Chaos%20Rituals.md) lore. However, each time a Magister learns a new spell (or reduces the difficulty of spell that he already knows) he must roll on the Heroes’ Post-game Injury Chart on page 60, treating any rolls of 'Captured' and 'Sold to the Pits' as 'Multiple Injuries' instead. (Learning spells will make a warrior count as a Wizard.)

## Cultists
**20gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
Cultist brethren are human cultists who worship the dark gods. Eager to walk the path of damnation, their vile deeds and black rituals acts have driven them to the brink of insanity. Cultists were mostly city-dwellers before the comet struck and as such they possessed no martial training. However, with their faith in the Dark Gods they can be a very determined fighting force.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 1   | 1   | +0  | 10+ | 10+ | 7+  | 8+  |

## 0-2 Pit Hounds
**30gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Pit Hounds are swift, ferocious wolves which have been tainted by Chaos, causing them to grow vicious horns that tear through shields and armour with ease. Appearing only after the fall of the comet, these Hellhounds naturally seem to flock to the vile Possessed and some even whisper  that the hounds emerged not from the forests of the Empire but from the pit of the comet itself.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9   | 1   | 1   | +0  | 8+  | -   | 5+  | 9+  |

**SPECIAL RULES**
**Armour Piercing 2**
**Daemons**: Cause Fear, No Pain (Treats Stunned as Knocked Down.)
**Animals**: Cannot Climb, Cannot Hide, Cannot use the Leader’s Ld, No Scenario Objectives, No Weapons or Armour, No Penalties for Fighting Unarmed, and No Experience.
## 0-4 Darksouls
**30gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Darksouls are men who have been driven insane by the daemonic spectacle that followed the destruction of Mordheim. In their tortured minds the Darksouls believe themselves to be surrounded by terrifying Daemons and the Cultists treat them accordingly by letting them work out their unreasoning rage in battle. Possessed covens have been known to equip these tortured souls with leering daemonic masks and to garb them in clothing and armour resembling the scaled skin of Daemons.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 1   | 1   | +0  | 10+ | -   | 7+  | 9+  |

**SPECIAL RULES**
**Immune to Fear, Immune to Panic**
**Heirloom**: Daemon Robes (Heirloom: Warrior has this item when hired. It may not be swapped or sold, but may be discarded and robbed as normal.)
## 0-2 Beastmen
**40gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Beastmen are cruel and spiteful creatures, who live who live in the forests of the Empire. In Mordheim they aid the Possessed, attracted by the Daemonic allure of the mysterious Shadowlord. Beastmen typically combine the legs and head of a goat with the upper body of a man. With their inhuman resistance to pain they are more than a match for most humans.

| M   | A   | W   | T   | WS  | BS  | I   | Ld  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8   | 1   | 1   | -1  | 9+  | 10+ | 7+  | 8+  |
