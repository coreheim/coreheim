Don’t believe everything those Witch Hunters say about the Sisters. They’re no more heretics than I am and I’ll skewer any man that says different. Not that the Sisters need looking after – they’re mean fighters and you gotta be tough just to live like they do in that big fortress in the middle of Mordheim.

**Starting Experience: 20**
The Sigmarite Matriarchs, of whom there is an inner circle of twelve, are answerable to the High Matriarch of the temple. Each must lead a warband of Sisters in frequent searches of the city in order to purge the ruins. Matriarchs are driven by a zealous devotion to the Cult of Sigmar and a relentless determination to redeem the Sisterhood in His eyes.

## 0-3 Sister Superiors
**30gc to hire
Starting Experience: 6**
Each of the Sisters Superior is a long-serving priestess of the Cult of Sigmar, well versed in the rituals of the temple and an example to the younger Sisters and Novices. The Sisters Superior are entrusted with maintaining the faith and fervour of the order. Any peril or foe that may lurk in the ruins of Mordheim is as nothing compared to the wrath of a Sister Superior.

# Henchmen
## Sister Novices
**20gc to hire
Starting Experience: 0**
By tradition, the Sisters draw their recruits only from the most noble houses of the Empire, and families consider it a great honour to have their daughter accepted into the order. Only maidens of noble lineage can be relied upon to have the devotion to duty and innate sense of honour. Few though the recruits may be, they must endure several years as Novices during which time their devotion will be tested to the full. All are eager to prove themselves worthy to be the handmaidens of Sigmar

## 0-4 Shield Maidens
**25gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
Sigmarite Sisters know that their entire order is shamed in the eyes of their Lord Sigmar. Every one of them is sworn upon His altar to pacify the city and thereby redeem themselves. Whatever the perils and horrors that stand in their way, they will be overcome!

## 0-2 Augurs
**25gc to hire**
**Starting Experience: 0**
The blind Augurs of the Sisterhood are blessed beyond their comrades. By giving up their sight they have gained something far more, second sight – a gift from their patron god. Only a very few are marked this way, and they are greatly revered by the Sisterhood. Unlike the rest of the priestesses, they shave their heads, save for a single long braid.
