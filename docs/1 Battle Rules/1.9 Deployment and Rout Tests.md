## Deployment
Most battles will start with each player deploying his warriors near their table edge.
- Warriors may be deployed up to **7”** inwards from the table edge if playing on a 4' by 4' size table. If playing on a smaller table then set up 2" inwards from the table edge.
- Warriors **cannot** be deployed above ground level.
# Rout Tests
Battles typically end when a warband **fails a Rout Test**.
A **Rout Test** is a **Leadership test** made by your Leader. Roll **2D6** and compare to his **Ld**.
- If the Leader is _out of action_, _knocked down_, or _stunned_, use the **best Ld** among remaining warriors who are **not** knocked down or stunned.
- If you **pass**, you may continue the battle **or rout voluntarily**.
- If you **fail**, your warband **flees the battle** and you are defeated.
## When to Take a Rout Test
At the **start of each of your turns**, take a Rout Test if either of the following conditions is met:
- **Four or more** members of your warband have been taken out of action.
   - _(Some warbands use a threshold of five or more; see individual warband lists.)_
- You have **three or fewer** warriors remaining on the table.
> _Mounts and Animals **count as warriors** for the purpose of Rout Tests._
# Voluntary Routs
At the **start of your turn**, if **three or more warriors** in your warband have been taken out of action, you may choose to **rout voluntarily**, even if not required to take a Rout Test.
