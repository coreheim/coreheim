## ⚔️ Critical Wounds, Overkill & Captured Rules
## 💀 Critical Wounds

- If you roll a **natural 12 on a melee or ranged attack**, you cause a **Critical Wound**.
- A Critical Wound counts as **two wounds**.
- Enemies make **armour saves as normal**, rolling separately for each wound.
- If the attacker needs a **12 to hit after modifiers**, **Critical Wounds cannot occur**.
- If the opponent has **fewer wounds than inflicted**, roll an **extra D12 for each excess wound** on the injury table and take the **highest result**.
## 🚨 Captured!

- When a warrior is **captured**, the warrior and **all weapons, armour, and equipment** transfer to the **enemy warband’s stash**.
- The capturers can:
    - Take or sell the captured warrior’s gear
    - Kill the captive to give **+1 experience** to a chosen hero
    - Ransom the captive back, **with or without equipment** as they wish
## 🧟‍♂️ Capturing Immortal Warriors

1. Immortal warriors **can be captured**.
2. **Shackles** help capture them.
3. Immortal warriors can only be held prisoner for **a single game**.
4. While imprisoned, capturers may choose to "**kill**" the immortal warrior, which inflicts a roll of **‘multiple injuries’** on them.
5. Players may negotiate a **ransom** as normal to avoid this.
