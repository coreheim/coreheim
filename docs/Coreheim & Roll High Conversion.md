## WS BS S I
- For Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative the skills are always roll equal to or higher in Coreheim Roll High.
 - While a skill can go down to a +1 which implies it always succeeds, it does not.
- A natural roll of 6 always succeeds and a natural 1 always fails.
- A +1 skill is useful for negating modifiers. Eg. Negating the move and fire debuff for ballistics.
```
7 - Mordheim Skill = Roll High Skill
```

| Mordheim Skill      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll High Skill** | +6  | +5  | +4  | +3  | +2  | +1  |

# Toughness
- Toughness is instead changed to be a modifier that impacts when a unit rolls Strength to wound your unit.
- Note that while a 6 always hits, it will only crit if your Strength roll to wound is a 5+ or better.
- The net result of these changes only impacts the extremes.
	- Automatic wounds are removed because a 1 will always miss.
	- Situations where a low Strength couldn't ever wound a high Toughness target are removed because a 6 will always hit.
```
Mordheim Toughness - 3 = Toughness Modifier
```

| Mordheim Toughness     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ---------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Toughness Modifier** | +2  | +1  | +0  | -1  | -2  | -3  |

# Leadership
- This is simply flipped to make leadership always roll high.
```
14 - Mordheim Ld = Roll High Ld
```

| Mordheim Leadership      | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  |
| ------------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll High Leadership** | +11 | +10 | +9  | +8  | +7  | +6  | +5  | +4  | +3  |
