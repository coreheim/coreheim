### **Recruiting a Warband**

- Start with **500gc** to buy warriors and equipment.
- **Miscellaneous Equipment** can **only be bought after** your first battle.
- At warband creation, **rare items** listed on your roster can be bought **without rarity rolls**.
- **You must recruit your designated leader** when forming your warband.
### **Starting Experience**

- Heroes **do not** receive advances from their starting XP.
### **Maximum Number of Heroes**

- Warbands may have **no more than 6 heroes** at any time.
- You may **fire any warband member at any time**.
### **Henchmen Groups**

- Henchmen are hired in groups of **1–5** with **identical equipment**.
- They **gain XP and level up as a group**.
- **Groups cannot split**, but they **can be merged**.
- Reinforcement is done in the **Trading Phase**.
- Groups of 2+ may **re-roll each advance once** — second result is final.
### **Warband Rating Calculation**

1. **[Number of warriors × 5]**
2. **[Total XP across all models]**
3. **[+15 per Monster]**
4. **[Hired Swords' rating]**
5. **= Total Warband Rating**

- If your rating is **50+ lower** than the enemy, you get **Underdog XP (before the battle)**.
- **Hired Swords** contribute their rating (base + XP).
### **Henchmen & Warband Rating Example**

- A 3-man group with 6 XP:
    - (3×5 = 15) + (6×3 = 18) → **Warband Rating = 33**
### **Reinforcing Experienced Henchmen**

- Roll **D6** — that’s the **total XP you can assign** to new recruits.
    - Example: Roll of 6 → recruit:
        - 1 henchman with 6 XP, or
        - 2 with 3 XP, or
        - 6 with 1 XP, etc.
- **Hiring cost remains the same**, regardless of experience.
