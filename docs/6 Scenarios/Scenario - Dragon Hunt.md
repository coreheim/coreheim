### 🗺️ Terrain
- The first building should be a **large, open ruin** placed in the **centre of the table** — this is the **dragon’s lair**.
## ⚔️ Special Rules
### 📍 The Dragon
- The dragon is **young** and **cannot fly** due to a life underground.
- The **dragon acts after the last warband** each turn.
- It will **charge** all models entering its lair if able, but **never leaves** the lair.
- It will:
    - Use its **breath weapon** on any model in range and line of sight.
    - **Prioritize models inside** the lair over those outside.
    - Try to **hit as many intruders as possible**.
    - If there are multiple options, it will **attack the closest** model.
