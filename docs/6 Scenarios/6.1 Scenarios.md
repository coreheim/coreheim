## **Scenario Rules**

### **Scenario Selection**

- The player with the **lowest warband rating** rolls 2D6 on the Scenario Table to determine the scenario.
    
- If the scenario defines **attackers and defenders**:
    
    - In 2-player games, the player with the **lowest rating chooses** their role.
        
    - In multiplayer games:
        
        - The **defender** is the player with the **highest warband rating**.
            
        - If tied, the player with **more models** becomes the defender.
            
        - If still tied, **roll a dice**.

### **Terrain Setup**

- Starting with the **player with the lowest warband rating**, each player places a piece of terrain (e.g., ruined buildings, towers).
    

---

### **Animal Restrictions**

- Animals **cannot** achieve victory conditions (e.g., carry objects, search, or enter key areas).
    

---

### **Deployment**

- **Defender** sets up first.
    
- All others roll D6; highest result sets up next, continuing in descending order.
    
- Roll for warriors with **Old Battle Wounds** before setup.
    
- Unless otherwise stated, all warriors **must deploy on ground level**.
    
- In basic games:
    
    - Player chooses a **table edge**, deploys within **6"**.
        
    - Opponent deploys within **6"** of the opposite edge.
        
    - In multiplayer, continue around the table.

### **Starting the Game**

- All players roll a D6. **Highest roll** goes first; play proceeds **clockwise** unless the scenario dictates otherwise.

### **Ending the Game**

- Game ends when all but one warband has **routed**, unless otherwise specified.
