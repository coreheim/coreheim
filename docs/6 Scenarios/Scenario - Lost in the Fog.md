### Deployment
- Players **take turns** deploying **one model at a time**.
- For each model:
    - Randomize a square in a **3×3 grid**.
    - Place the model somewhere in that square.
    - No model should be placed within **2"** of another.
### Starting the Game
- The **attacker takes the first turn**.
### Fog Rules (Attacker's First Turn Only)
- **Ranged attacks & magic** can only target enemies **within the attacker's Initiative value in inches**.
    - A **lantern adds +4"** to this range.
- Warriors attempting to **charge** must pass an **Initiative test** or **fail the charge**.
- **Fog lifts** after the attacker’s first turn.
