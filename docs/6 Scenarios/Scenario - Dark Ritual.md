**Type:** Multiplayer (2+ warbands)  
**Setting:** Occult conflict in ruined Mordheim  
**Theme:** Stop the ritual before it's completed — or ensure it's completed for dark power.

---

## Background

The broken city of Mordheim draws not only treasure seekers, but cults and madmen who worship the dark powers. In a shattered chapel deep in the ruins, a foul ritual is underway — and it must be either stopped, or completed, depending on your allegiance.

---

## Warbands

- **Number of Players:** 2 to 4 warbands
- **Special Note:** One warband (randomly determined) starts as the **Cultists** — those conducting the ritual. The others are Interrupters.
  - If more than 2 warbands: players may secretly bid gold crowns (0–30) during setup to become the Cultists.

---

## Terrain

- Use a ruined temple, chapel, or central plaza as the focal point.
- Place an **Unholy Altar** at the center of the board.
- Random scatter terrain surrounds the center, allowing approach from all sides.
- 4–6 **Ritual Circles** (objectives) are placed evenly within 6"–10" of the Altar.

---

## Setup

1. **Determine Cultist Warband**:
   - Roll off or resolve bidding.
   - The Cultist warband sets up first, within 8" of the Unholy Altar.
2. **Interrupters** deploy randomly:
   - Roll a D6 for each and assign a board edge (1–4 for edges, 5–6 choose).
   - Deploy within 6" of that edge.
3. Place **Ritual Tokens** face down (one is the **True Focus**) — only the Cultists know which.

---

## Objectives

- **Cultists**: Complete the ritual (see below) by the end of turn 8 or eliminate all enemies.
- **Interrupters**: Stop the ritual by disrupting all ritual circles or taking down the Altar bearer.

---

## Special Rules

### The Ritual

- The Cultists must **complete 3 successful Ritual Actions**:
  - A Ritual Action is a full-turn action taken by a hero in base contact with a Ritual Circle.
  - Roll a Leadership test. On success, place a Ritual Success marker.
  - Ritual Circles can be used only once.
- If 3 Ritual Success markers are placed **and** the Altar bearer survives until end of turn 8, the ritual is completed.

### Unholy Altar

- Treated as a large object; may not be moved.
- If an Interrupter model ends its turn in base contact, they may destroy it on a D6 roll of 6.
  - +1 to roll for each other friendly model in contact.
  - Destroying the altar cancels all Ritual Progress immediately.

### Chaos Powers Intervene

- At the start of each turn, roll a D6:
  - On a 6, strange powers warp the battlefield.
    - Roll a D6 on the following table:

| D6 | Effect |
|----|--------|
| 1  | All models take a Str 2 hit (ethereal fire). |
| 2  | Random warband loses a turn (frozen in time). |
| 3  | Fog descends — range of all missile fire halved this turn. |
| 4  | Shadows scream — all fear tests at -1. |
| 5  | Daemonic whispering — all leadership tests at -1. |
| 6  | Chaos surge — random Ritual Circle becomes unusable (explodes). |

---

## Ending the Game

- Game ends after 8 turns or if only one warband remains.
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - **Cultists Victory**: Ritual completed.
  - **Interrupters Victory**: Ritual stopped or Cultists routed/eliminated.

---

## Experience

- +1 Survives Battle
- +1 Per Enemy Out of Action
- +1 For completing or disrupting a Ritual Circle
- +2 If your warband destroyed the Altar
- +2 If your warband completed the ritual

---

## Optional Twist

- After the ritual is completed or stopped, a **random Daemon** is summoned!
  - Use a profile from the Possessed or Chaos Daemons list.
  - It acts independently and attacks all nearby models at random.
