### 🌀 Rat Abilities
- **Chaotic Movement**:
    - Move each rat **2D6" in a random direction** each Movement phase.
    - If it contacts another model, it **engages in close combat**.
    - If moving into contact with a model that causes **fear**, it must take a **Leadership test**, or suffer **-1 to hit** in that round.
- **Short Attention Span**:
    - Must roll for **All Alone** as normal.
    - However, at the start of its next turn, it **automatically rallies** and resumes random movement.
- **Almost Had It!**:
    - A model **charging** an unengaged Giant Rat must pass an **Initiative test** or the rat **slips away 2"** directly away.
    - If this slip brings the rat into base contact with another model, they engage, but **no one counts as charging**.
## 📦 Special Rules
- **They’ve Eaten Our Treasure, Lads!**:
    - Each **dead rat contains wyrdstone**.
    - A **standing warrior**, **not in close combat**, may end its turn in **base contact** with a dead rat to **pick it up**.
        - **Animals cannot do this**.
    - If a model carrying a dead rat is taken out of action, it **drops** the rat at the spot.
    - A model **leaving the board** with a dead rat **may not return**, but is **not out of action**.
    - Any dead rats **left on the ground** at game’s end are **lost**.
- **Unstable Mutations**:
    - At the **start of each Close Combat phase**, roll **1D6 per rat**:
        - `1`: +1 Attack
        - `2–3`: +1 to Strength rolls
        - `4–5`: -1 Toughness modifier
        - `6`: +1 Toughness modifier
