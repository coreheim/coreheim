# ⚔️ Serious Injury Table

**Roll 2D6** (first die = **tens**, second die = **ones**).
## 📜 General Rules

- Heroes may acquire multiple instances of the same injury.
- Injuries still **count against future characteristic advances**.
- Injuries **do not** affect the **maximum characteristic** cap.
- **Heroes cannot die** in a warband’s first **two games** — treat **‘Dead’** results as **‘Multiple Injuries’** instead.
- **Mounts roll separately** from their riders (they follow **henchman rules** for injury rolls).
- Mounts are **never robbed** or used in **Pit Fights**.
