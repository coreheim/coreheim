# üõ°Ô∏è Intercepting Enemies
If a warrior is **within 2‚Äù of an enemy‚Äôs movement path**, and **not already engaged in close combat**, that warrior may **intercept** the enemy.

- The intercepting warrior **moves into the enemy‚Äôs path**.
- The enemy counts as **charging the intercepting warrior**.
- Each moving enemy can be intercepted by **only one warrior**.
- Interception can be made against **all types of enemy moves**:
    - Normal moves
    - Running moves
    - Charging moves
    - Flying moves
- If either model causes **fear**, apply fear as normal.

### Important: Warriors Cannot ‚ÄúStep Up‚Äù to Intercept

- To intercept a move or charge, the warrior **must be on the flanks of the movement path** as shown in the diagram.
- This means a warrior **cannot intercept if positioned behind the original target** of the charge.
- For example, if a warrior charges from the left to the right, a comrade **behind the warrior on the right cannot ‚Äústep up‚Äù to intercept**.
